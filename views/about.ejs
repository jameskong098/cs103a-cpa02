    About the Developer
  </h1>
  <ul>
    <text>My name is James Kong, and I am an undergraduate at Brandeis University pursuing a B.S degree in Computer Science. I have always had a mindset of perseverance, and I welcome all forms of collaboration with others. I have experience with OOP and data structures in Java from school courses and independent projects made for fun. During my spare time, I also enjoy teaching introductory Python to younger kids.</text>
